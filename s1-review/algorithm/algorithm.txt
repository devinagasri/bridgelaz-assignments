1, at first we are taking all the files in the directory
2, and i am taking 'name' before'.' as x and name after '.' as x1 (example 'add' as x and 'java' as x1)
3, if the add directory is already present in 'stage1-review directory' then we need to remove that particular 'add' directory
4, then we need to create add directory 'x'(add/) and java directoryn1 (add/java)
5, then we need to copy the file(add.java) in 'stage1-review' to 'add/java/' likewise every file(multiply.py, Division.cd, Sub.js day4.sh) will be created and copied
